 <h1>ABOUT NPTEL</h1><p>The National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL), a project funded by
the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), provides e-learning through online
Web and Video courses in Engineering, Sciences, Technology, Management and Humanities.
This is a joint initiative by seven IITs and IISc Bangalore. Other selected premier institutions
also act as Associate Partner Institutions.
NPTEL is a curriculum building exercise and is directed towards providing learning materials
in science and engineering by adhering to the syllabi of All India Council for Technical
Education and the slightly modified curricula of major affiliating Universities. It has
developed curriculum based video courses and web-based e-courses targeting students and
faculty of institutions offering UG engineering programs.</p>
